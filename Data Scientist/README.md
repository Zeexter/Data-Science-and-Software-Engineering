To be a Data Scientist, you have to be able to analyze your data and crack complex data problems with a strong expertise in a certain scientific discipline (as coined by DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher). Again, it is **data** + **complex data problems**. So the required skills can be summarized as follow
* **Data**: Get, store (structure) and produce data.
Yes, It is
  * Get data from files, databases, web documents or any other data source
  * Structure data in memory as list, tree, graph or any other data structure
  * Publish you results in a data destination
* **Complex data problems**: solve problems, write algorithms, and analyze such algorithms.



** Algorithms and Theoretical Computer Science 
The main reference for this course is the "Building Blocks for Theoretical Computer Science (Version 1.3) Margaret M. Fleck January 1, 2013" book. It is a very good book for undergraduate students to be a start for Theoretical illustration behind the Algorithms.
